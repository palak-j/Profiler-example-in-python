# Profiler-example-in-python

Sometimes while writing a code, we stuck in the situation where our code is taking unreasonably long time to execute. In this case, it is very important to figure out where our code is going slow and profiler plays a very important role in figuring that out.  <br>


In this python notebook (Profiler Example.ipynb), I have demonstrated how to use profiler to check where our code is going slow and how to make it faster. <br>
